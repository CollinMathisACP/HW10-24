<h1>Correlation and Causation<h1>
<h2>What is correlation used for?</h2>
<p>
Correlation is used when there is a linear relationship between two quantitative variables.
</p>

<h2>What is the difference between correlation and causation?</h2>
<p>
Correlation quantifies the relationship between the two variables, but it says nothing about why that relationship exists. Causation states 
that one variable directly affects the other (or they both affect one another.) Causation can only be established by running randomized 
controlled experiments.
</p>

<h2>Compare and contrast 3 different ways to visually show relationships.</h2>
<p>A standard scatter plot displays data points on a chart with each variable as one of the axes. From those points, the coefficient of 
corralation can be superimposed.
</p>

<p>A regression model is a scatter plot where the x-axis is an explanatory variable and the y-axis is a response variable. This means that
the chart has a predictive quality, and can be used to anticipate the results of changing the relationship. This is in contrast to other 
methods, which can only be used to examine the data that has been recorded.
</p>

<p>Relationship charts can also be transformed using the techniques we read about earlier. For example, exponential data can be displayed
logarithmically to reveal a linear relationship.</p>
